# lab-2-maze
To compile - start with Lab2.java, compiling this should also compile the other files in the directory.

Running Lab2 will run the program after it has been compiled

Directions are: 
* "f" = go forward
* "l" = go left
* "r" = go right
* "e" = to escape
  
Enter in directions (f, l, r). When finished, enter "e", and it will give you the directions to escape.
